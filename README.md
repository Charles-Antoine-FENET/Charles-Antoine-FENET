#### Just one more thing...
<div align="center">
I spent 10 years as a business developer for some of the most beautiful consumer products companies. Managing objectives, selling, negotiation, organization, questioning, and listening to find the real needs were among the many things I learned during that time. <br/><br/>
In 2021, I decided to pursue an old dream of becoming a programmer and being able to create things from scratch with only my brain and my laptop. I'm convinced that combining my previous experiences with this new programming skill can be really interesting. <br/>Let's do it together üî•
